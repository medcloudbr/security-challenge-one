![logo medcloud-03 white copy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46347123/158176045-de9fefb0-35e2-4515-83ff-c132608aa870.png)

About Medcloud:

We make exams and medical data management more flexible, secure and effective by accelerating the transition from clinics and hospitals to the cloud.
The RIS and PACS systems have been practically the same for the past 25 years. Interoperability problems, high costs and a lack of understanding about the patient's access to his medical records.

These points defined limits for the doctor-patient relationship and barriers to radiology workflows. We are revolutionizing this through a Care Coordination based solution that improves workflows for providers and integrates doctors and patients for a better experience.

Since our foundation, almost 10 years ago, we have prioritized excellence in the management of health data, structuring workflows of health professionals, clinics, laboratories and hospitals for assertive and quality diagnostics.

We understand that behind each medical record there is a patient seeking to improve his health and the hope of family members for his well being. After all, we are all patients, and Medcloud's mission is to help you live longer and better. #PatientFirst

## Goal

You are responsible for evaluating the security of your company's network. Your task is to perform a vulnerability analysis on a specific machine on the network and report the findings. This machine is a web server running the WordPress content management system. Its mission is to identify and document any vulnerability or possible security breach in the WordPress server.
  
## Required

- Access this WordPress server https://fernandobarreto2504815.wordpress.com .
- Run a security scan to identify potential vulnerabilities in your WordPress configuration.
- Document all findings, including information about any vulnerabilities found, their severities, and steps for mitigation.
- Make sure the analysis is done in a non-intrusive way, that is, without making changes to the server or website.
- Present your findings in a written report, including a brief explanation of how each vulnerability could be exploited and recommendations for fixing them.
  
## What will be evaluated:

- Identify common vulnerabilities in WordPress web servers.
- Clearly document your findings.
- Propose solutions or mitigation measures for the vulnerabilities found.
- Communicate your findings concisely and effectively through the Vulnerability Analysis report.
 
## Delivery

You MUST clone this repository to your own private repository and push your code to it. DO NOT FORK THIS REPOSITORY.
When you finish it, you must send an email to cv@medcloud.com.br with your curriculum and share
the private repository with github.com/medcloud-engineer.

Good luck! Any doubts, feel free to send an email to cv@medcloud.com.br.

## For the day of the technical interview

On the date set by the recruiter, have your application running on your local machine to run the tests and to show us the points developed and possible questions. We will do a code review together with you as if you were already on our team, you will be able to explain what you thought, how you architected and how the project can evolve. Good luck!
